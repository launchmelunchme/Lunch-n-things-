As a 25-year-old Computer Science student, I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree at the University of Hong Kong. I moved here from mainland China to immerse myself in the city's dynamic tech scene, captivated by its blend of Eastern tradition and cutting-edge innovation. My foundation in tech was built at Tsinghua University, where I earned my Bachelor's in Software Engineering. It was there that I developed a strong grasp of algorithms and data structures, and also where my passion for cloud-native infrastructure and open-source began to truly flourish.

I'm fascinated by the power of collaborative, community-driven projects to create transformative technology. This interest has been central to my work, particularly in my focus on artificial intelligence for sustainable urban development. For a major project, I led a team in developing an AI-powered app to optimize public transportation routes in cities like Hong Kong. This entire project was built on a cloud-native stack, leveraging open-source tools to ensure scalability and efficiency. The experience solidified my belief that open collaboration is the key to building robust and impactful solutions. During an internship at a local fintech startup, I contributed to blockchain-based security protocols, which further deepened my appreciation for distributed, open systems.

This experience solidified my belief that open collaboration is the key to building robust and impactful solutions. To further practice this belief, I am currently contributing to the cloud-native open-source community as a Software Engineer Intern at Layer5.

When I'm not immersed in my studies or contributing to an open-source project, I enjoy exploring Hong Kong's hiking trails, practicing calligraphy to stay connected to my cultural roots, and experimenting with fusion cuisine that reflects my multicultural experiences.

My long-term vision is to create inclusive technology that empowers communities. I plan to continue this work after graduation, whether through a PhD or by joining a leading tech firm. I'm especially keen on developing ethical AI solutions on open, cloud-native platforms, as I believe this is the most effective way to foster a transparent and equitable technological future. My blend of technical expertise, adaptability, and unwavering curiosity makes me a rising star in this global landscape.
